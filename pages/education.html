                        Purdue was my gateway to the world of data science, courtesy of pandemic-induced career
                        soul-searching.
                        My days at AB InBev where I wrestled with Excel spreadsheets and played statistical detective
                        to save the company some dollars, had planted a seed. The pandemic gave me way too much time to
                        think, and
                        I realized I was genuinely obsessed with turning numbers into stories. Purdue's
                        world-class Business Analytics program called to me from across the oceans. Ten months
                        of intense learning later, surrounded by brilliant minds from every corner of the globe, I
                        somehow managed to stand out in this incredible crowd. The cherry on top was landing one of the
                        most coveted Data Scientist spots at BCG. From fixing brewery floors in India to the consulting
                        towers in New York, it's been one wild ride. The takeaway? Never stop learning.

                        BITS was four years of organized chaos where I juggled Mechanical Engineering, a Finance minor,
                        and an
                        unhealthy obsession with building an ATV. I rose through the ranks of Inspired Karters - BAJA
                        team, to be the leader of 32 brilliant engineers, designing vehicles that could handle anything
                        except my driving. Between managing the team, contributing to cultural and mechanical
                        association events, and showing up to all the parties, I somehow graduated. The universe
                        rewarded
                        this beautiful madness when AB InBev rolled up with one of the coolest jobs at the Budweiser
                        brewery. Thing to always remember - Make sure I enjoy the work I do and the people I do it with.

                        Spent 14 years at this gem of a place where I found lifelong friends and amazing mentors who
                        shaped my early years. I was always the child with 'potential' (teacher code for 'tries hard,
                        achieves little') and kept my distance from the academic success my parents were hoping for.
                        Then came the plot twist: I somehow scored the highest in the entire school during 12th grade
                        board exams. That (unexpected) success gave me the boost I needed to tackle India's (in)famous
                        competitive entrance exams and secure my ticket to BITS Pilani. The biggest lesson? Confidence
                        is king!

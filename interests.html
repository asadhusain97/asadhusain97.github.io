            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending my time outdoors. Hiking and photography are two of my favorite
                ways to unwind and appreciate the natural world. There's nothing quite like capturing a beautiful
                landscape or a unique moment in time.</p>

            <p>I'm also a big fan of music. I play the guitar and enjoy discovering new artists and genres. Music is a
                great way to relax and express creativity, and I find it to be a great source of inspiration for my
                work.</p>

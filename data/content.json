            "description": "Purdue was my gateway to the world of data science, courtesy of pandemic-induced career soul-searching. My days at AB InBev where I wrestled with Excel spreadsheets and played statistical detective to save the company some dollars, had planted a seed. The pandemic gave me way too much time to think, and I realized I was genuinely obsessed with turning numbers into stories. Purdue's world-class Business Analytics program called to me from across the oceans. Ten months of intense learning later, surrounded by brilliant minds from every corner of the globe, I somehow managed to stand out in this incredible crowd. The cherry on top was landing one of the most coveted Data Scientist spots at BCG. From fixing brewery floors in India to the consulting towers in New York, it's been one wild ride. The takeaway? Never stop learning."

I rose through the ranks of Inspired Karters - BAJA team, to be the leader of 32 brilliant engineers, designing vehicles that could handle anything except my driving. Between managing the team, contributing to cultural and mechanical association events, and showing up to all the parties, I somehow graduated. The universe rewarded this beautiful madness when AB InBev rolled up with one of the coolest jobs at the Budweiser brewery. Thing to always remember - Make sure I enjoy the work I do and the people I do it with."

I was always the child with 'potential' (teacher code for 'tries hard, achieves little') and kept my distance from the academic success my parents were hoping for. Then came the plot twist: I somehow scored the highest in the entire school during 12th grade board exams. That (unexpected) success gave me the boost I needed to tackle India's (in)famous competitive entrance exams and secure my ticket to BITS Pilani. The biggest lesson? Confidence is king!"

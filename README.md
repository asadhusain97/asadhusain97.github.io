# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website. It is a simple, static website built with HTML and CSS.

## File Structure

The website is organized into the following directories:

- `css/`: Contains the stylesheet for the website.
- `projects/`: Contains the individual project pages.
- `pages/`: Contains the other pages of the website, such as `education.html` and `interests.html`.

The main entry point for the website is `index.html`.

## Updating the Website

To add a new project, create a new HTML file in the `projects/` directory and add a link to it in `projects.html`. To add a new page, create a new HTML file in the `pages/` directory and add a link to it in the navigation bar of the other pages.

        <h3>What I Built</h3>
        <p>A full-stack Flutter web app where my friends and I create and play custom quizzes together. Think of it as
            our own private quiz show - we take turns being quizmaster and contestants, complete with buzzer
            functionality and score tracking.</p>
        <h3>The Motivation</h3>
        <p>My friend group loves trivia nights, but existing apps never quite fit what we wanted. So instead of settling
            for generic quiz platforms, I decided to learn Flutter and build exactly what we needed. Classic developer
            move: "I can build that better myself."
        </p>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Custom Quiz Creation:</b> We use a shared Google Sheet to create questions and categories - everyone
            contributes
            their own rounds and question sets.
            <br>
            <b>Live Game Experience:</b> One person hosts as quizmaster, navigating through the question board while
            others
            buzz in to answer. Inspired by "Buzzing with Kvizzing" format.
            <br>
            </b>Real-time Scoring:</b> Built-in leaderboard tracks everyone's performance throughout the game, with undo
            functionality for those "wait, that was actually right" moments.
            <br>
            <b>Web-based:</b> Runs in any browser, so no app downloads needed - just share the link and everyone's ready
            to
            play.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Journey</h3>
        <p>First time diving deep into Flutter, so this was a crash course in mobile/web app development. Built the
            entire frontend, handled state management, integrated with Google Sheets as a backend, and figured out
            real-time game mechanics.
            The buzzer functionality was particularly fun to implement - had to think about timing, multiple player
            inputs, and making sure the fastest finger actually wins.</p>
        <h3>Impact and Future Plans</h3>
        <p>The real win isn't the code - it's the quality time with friends. We've had some epic quiz nights thanks to
            this app, and everyone's gotten surprisingly competitive about creating better questions.
            I'm excited to turn this into a standalone product for quiz enthusiasts everywhere. Planning features like
            user profiles, quiz marketplace, improved buzzer system, and a way for quiz communities to share and
            discover content.</p>
        <p><b>Technologies Used:</b> Flutter, Dart, Google Sheets API, Web deployment</p>
        <p><i>Personal project, 2025 - ongoing</i></p>

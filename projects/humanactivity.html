        <h3>What I Built</h3>
        <p>A neural network classifier that analyzes 15-second accelerometer data from wearable safety devices to
            automatically detect workplace incidents. The system distinguishes between slips, trips, falls, and other
            activities - crucial for worker safety monitoring and emergency response.</p>
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>This was an industry-sponsored project through Purdue's DataMine team. Our client had workers wearing safety
            devices that collected accelerometer data, but needed an automated way to classify incidents for faster
            emergency response and better safety analytics.</p>
        <p>Working with 986,250 rows of raw sensor data - my first time handling this much real-world data. Each
            incident captured 375 acceleration measurements (25Hz over 15 seconds) in x, y, and z directions, triggered
            when acceleration exceeded 2Gs in any direction.
        </p>
        <h3>How I solved it</h3>
        <p><b>Feature Engineering Deep Dive:</b> Transformed basic x,y,z accelerometer readings into 20+ meaningful
            features.
            Started with simple stats (mean, max, variance) but got creative with signal processing techniques like
            Fourier transforms to capture movement patterns.
            <br><b>Neural Network Learning Curve:</b> This was my introduction to deep learning, so I experimented with
            both
            traditional MLPs and CNNs. Had to learn everything from scratch - backpropagation, activation functions, the
            whole nine yards.
            <br><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> The tricky part was teaching the model that a "slip" has different
            acceleration
            signatures than a "trip" or "fall." Each type of incident creates distinct patterns in the sensor data.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Breakthroughs</h3>
        <p>The biggest learning was understanding how time-series data works differently than typical classification
            problems. Had to think about temporal patterns, not just individual data points.
            Feature engineering was where the magic happened - raw accelerometer values don't mean much, but when you
            extract the right statistical and frequency-domain features, the patterns become clear.</p>
        <h3>Results and Impact</h3>
        <p>Achieved 74% precision in classifying workplace incidents, which was a solid improvement for this type of
            safety-critical application. More importantly, this could mean faster emergency response times and better
            workplace safety insights for the client.</p>

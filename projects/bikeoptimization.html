        <h3>What I Built</h3>
        <p>I tackled five optimization challenges for Austin's bike sharing system using 130K+ trip records. This was my
            first real dive into data structures and algorithms, and I loved figuring out how to turn complex problems
            into practical solutions.</p>
        <h3>The Problems I Solved</h3>
        <p><b>Route Optimization:</b> Maintenance staff were traveling 43km daily visiting all kiosks randomly. I used
            the
            Traveling Salesman Problem to cut this down to 37km, saving $60/day in travel costs.
            <br><b>Trip Prediction:</b> Built an XGBoost model to predict how long bikes would be rented based on
            weather,
            location, and user type. Hit 8.48% accuracy, helping with inventory planning.
            <br><b>Smart Clustering:</b> When the company wanted to test new kiosk tech, I clustered stations by
            popularity using
            graph theory and K-means so they could safely pilot on low-risk locations.
            <br><b>Strategic Downsizing:</b> COVID hit demand, so they needed to close 5-10 kiosks. I built a linear
            programming
            model that identified which 10 to close while keeping revenue intact and meeting business constraints.
            <br><b>Network Coverage:</b> Found the minimum number of kiosks needed for city-wide connectivity (turns out
            it's 41
            out of 44 - almost all of them!).
        </p>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>This project was my crash course in turning theoretical CS concepts into real business value. Going from
            "here's an algorithm" to "this saves $60 per day" was incredibly satisfying. Plus, working with messy
            real-world data taught me that the best technical solution isn't always the most complex one.</p>
        <p><b>Technologies Used:</b> Python, NetworkX, scikit-learn, XGBoost, PuLP, Jupyter Notebooks</p>

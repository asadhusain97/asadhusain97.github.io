        <h3>What I Built</h3>
        <p>I got tired of manually parsing our 10-person family plan bill every month (mostly friends sharing costs), so
            I built a fully automated system that does it for me. Now, the moment I get the bill notification on my
            phone, I can generate the cost breakdown in seconds without ever leaving the file viewer. It turns a manual
            15-minute spreadsheet chore into a single tap.
            Every month I'd spend 15 minutes going through T-Mobile's 6-page PDF bill, manually extracting each person's
            charges, calculating splits, and sending everyone their portion. It was frustrating why T-Mobile would
            not automatically do it in the bill when Verizon and AT&T do, but now I don't mind since I learned a lot
            during this build. It wasn't a huge time sink honestly, but the motivation to do it was basically zero.
            Classic "I'll spend 10 hours automating a 15-minute task" situation.

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            <b>On-Device Python Environment:</b> Instead of relying on external servers, I cloned my repository directly
            onto my iPhone using a-shell, a terminal emulator that allows Python scripts to run locally on iOS.
            <br>
            <b>iOS Shortcut Integration:</b> I configured a custom Apple Shortcut that acts as a bridge between the iOS
            share sheet and the Python script.
            <br>
            <b>Smart PDF Parsing:</b> This was the trickiest part. I tried OCR and ML approaches first, but T-Mobile's
            PDFs are messy. Ended up using keyword-based text extraction to grab exactly what I needed from the bill
            summary and do simple maths to get exactly how much each person owes.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
        <p>The biggest challenge was optimizing the workflow for a mobile environment. I had to ensure the Python
            environment within a-shell was robust enough to handle the data processing libraries and configure the input
            arguments so the script could dynamically accept the PDF path passed down from the iOS Shortcut. </p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>Been running rock-solid since September 2024. Added more features over time and made
            it generic so other families can adapt it. Saves me 15 minutes monthly, but more importantly, I never have
            to think about bill splitting again.</p>
        <p><b>Technologies Used:</b> Python, a-shell, pandas, PDF parsing, YAML configs</p>

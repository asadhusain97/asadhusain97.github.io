        <h3>What I Built</h3>
        <p>I got tired of manually parsing our 10-person family plan bill every month (mostly friends sharing costs), so
            I built a fully automated system that does it for me. Now I just email the bill to a specific address, and
            boom - everyone gets a breakdown of what they owe.</p>
        <h3>The Problems I Solved</h3>
        <p>Every month I'd spend 30 minutes going through T-Mobile's 6-page PDF bill, manually extracting each person's
            charges, calculating splits, and sending everyone their portion. It wasn't a huge time sink, but the
            motivation to do it was basically zero. Classic "I'll spend 10 hours automating a 30-minute task" situation.
        </p>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Email-Triggered Workflow:</b> Forward the T-Mobile bill to my automation email with a specific subject
            line, then wait for the magic to happen.
            <br>
            <b>Smart PDF Parsing:</b> This was the trickiest part. I tried OCR and ML approaches first, but T-Mobile's
            PDFs are messy. Ended up using keyword-based text extraction to grab exactly what I needed from the bill
            summary.
            <br>
            <b>GitHub Actions Automation:</b> Runs on a daily cron job (12 PM) using GitHub Actions for free cloud
            hosting. Checks for new bills, processes them, and emails everyone their split.
            <br>
            <b>Complete Pipeline:</b> Email retrieval → PDF parsing → bill analysis → automated summary emails to all
            family members.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
        <p>First time working with email automation (IMAP/SMTP) and GitHub Actions, so lots of learning on the fly. The
            PDF parsing was brutal - tried multiple approaches before settling on reliable keyword-based extraction. Had
            to handle Gmail app passwords, environment variables, and making the whole thing generic enough that others
            could use it.</p>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>Been running rock-solid since September 2024 with just minor hiccups. Added more features over time and made
            it generic so other families can adapt it. Saves me 30 minutes monthly, but more importantly, I never have
            to think about bill splitting again.</p>
        <p><b>Technologies Used:</b> Python, GitHub Actions, IMAP/SMTP, pandas, PDF parsing, YAML configs</p>
